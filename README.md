# Customized Innovaphone WebRTC demo

[Innovaphone](https://innovaphone.com) offers a JS-Library to connect to their PBX and use it as a WebRTC Backend.
This repo is for testing, proof of concept and adding features or themes.


# Themes
Themes can be applied by loading the custom stylesheet after all the other stylesheets.
Doing so will overwrite selectors if specified in the custom stylesheet, otherwise the default style will be applied.

Themes can be found in `/webrtc/css`

A Live-Demo can be found here: [https://webrtc.persk.es](https://webrtc.persk.es)
